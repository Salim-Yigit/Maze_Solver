# Maze_Solver 
This code is our final project of Data Structes and Algorithms course. 
Maze is given by our instructor in the file and we read the maze from this file. 
While we reach the exit if we hit a dead end,we lose 5 points.
I create 20 apples and I  randomly placed these apples. 'O' represent apples. 
If we come across the apples,we gain 10 points.
I marked the places we passed with star('*'),also I delete the stars if we hit a dead end.
I used uslepp funtion to increase understandability. 
'-','+','/' symbols represent the walls.Every move on the top I printed the current point.
